# Advanced React API

Records and stores data for an e-commerce platform, including customers, products and orders. This connects to a back-end API that I developed using Flask. You can find that back-end API here: https://github.com/samuelckraft/Project---E-Commerce-API.git.

Make sure to clone and run the API before running the React application.
